# Meet Parekh's Portfolio Website

Hey there! This is my portfolio website created for CS6.201 assignment. I built this site to showcase who I am and what I've done so far. The website has sections for my intro, some cool pics of my birthplace, my education journey (with those JEE scores!), skills I've picked up along the way, and a downloadable CV. I went with a dark theme because I think it looks slick, and added some animations to make things more interesting. Everything's responsive so it works on phones too.

For Q2 and Q3, I implemented event tracking that logs all clicks and page views to both the console and a visible event log. The format follows the assignment specs with timestamp, event type, and object description. The text analyzer in the TextBox section breaks down any pasted text (ideally 10,000+ words) into basic stats (letters, words, spaces), counts pronouns, prepositions, and articles, and displays the results in a neat grid layout. The analyzer tokenizes text into words and matches against predefined lists to get accurate counts.

I used LLMs a bit to help me understand some CSS tricks for the animations and responsive design. They were super helpful for figuring out the tokenization approach for the text analysis in Q3 and explaining how event delegation works for Q2's click tracking. I got stuck with some JavaScript debugging at one point and an LLM helped me figure out why my event listeners weren't capturing everything correctly. But all the core implementation and design decisions were mine - the LLMs just helped me understand the concepts better.
